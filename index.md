Already at its 6th edition, this is an intensive course on innovative uses of museum’s resources for vertebrate’s research. By the end of this course students will have an updated overview of the potential of museum collections for biodiversity research

## training

The host instructors, from cE3c-FCUL, CIBIO-InBIO and the Museum of Natural History and Science of the University of Porto (MHNCUP) and invited instructors from the National Museum of Natural History and Science of the University of Lisbon (MUHNAC) and from Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates (CUMV), will share their knowledge and experience on preparing, curating, and using museum specimens. This will be complemented by online lectures of several invited researchers.

In addition, students will practice how to prepare bird and mammal specimens, how tissues can be obtained and preserved for a variety of uses, and how to obtain coloration data and how to prepare 3D models and digital vouchers.
