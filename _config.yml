  bio: "The Ricardo Jorge Lopes Lab at the FCUL and CE3C uses birds to study the importance of key traits on the evolution and long-term conservation of biodiversity. These range from coloration and trophic interactions to host-parasite systems. As Curator of the Avian Collection of the MUHNAC - National Museum of Natural History and Science and Invited Curator at the MHNC-UP - Natural History and Science Museum of the University of Porto, we promote the value of avian specimens for research."
